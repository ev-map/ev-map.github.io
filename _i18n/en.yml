faq: FAQ
faq_general: General
faq_colors: What do the different colors of the charging station icons on the map mean?
faq_colors_desc: "The meanings are listed below:"
faq_colors_table_header_icon: Icon
faq_colors_table_header_charging_power: Charging power
faq_colors_table_at_least: at least
faq_double_bolt: What does it mean if a charging station has an icon with two lightning bolts?
faq_double_bolt_desc: If the icon contains two lightning bolts, the charging site has more than one connector. If a filter for specific connectors or a certain charging power is selected, the icon only applies to the selected types of connectors.
faq_connector_colors: What do the different colors of the connectors mean?
faq_connector_colors_desc: "In the detail view of a charging station, the connectors are shown with real-time availability data shown with different colors, as listed below:"
faq_connector_colors_green: Green
faq_connector_colors_green_desc: At least one connector of this type is available
faq_connector_colors_red: Red
faq_connector_colors_red_desc: All connectors of this type are out of order
faq_connector_colors_teal: Teal
faq_connector_colors_teal_desc: All connectors of this type are in use or out of order
faq_connector_colors_grey: Grey
faq_connector_colors_grey_desc: No real-time data available
faq_verified: What does the green checkmark next to a charging station's name mean?
faq_verified_desc: This charger has been verified by a member of the community (either at
  [GoingElectric.de](https://www.goingelectric.de/stromtankstellen/) or
  [OpenChargeMap.org](https://openchargemap.org/), depending on the selected data source), which means that at least one
  successful charging session has been reported and there is no current fault report. Of course this does not
  necessarily mean that the charger is still accessible and in working order. If a charger is not working, please report
  it at [GoingElectric.de](https://www.goingelectric.de/stromtankstellen/) or
  [OpenChargeMap.org](https://openchargemap.org/).
faq_fdroid: What is F-Droid and why are there differences between the versions of the app available on F-Droid and the Google Play Store?
faq_fdroid_desc_1: "[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) is an alternative Android app store that focuses on free and open source (FOSS) apps. As per F-Droid's policies, apps available through its store must not contain proprietary dependencies, such as certain Google services. Thus, the version of EVMap available on F-Droid contains some changes to remove such dependencies. The details can be found in the list below."
faq_fdroid_desc_2: Due to the downsides mentioned below, it is **recommended** for most users **to install the app from Google Play** to have access to all features. The F-Droid release is mainly intended to provide an alternative means of installation for devices that cannot access Google services or users who would like to avoid them.
faq_fdroid_changes: "Changes in the F-Droid version of EVMap:"
faq_fdroid_changes_1: Map data and place search are solely provided by **Mapbox (OpenStreetMap)**, while the Google Play version offers a choice between Google Maps and Mapbox.
faq_fdroid_changes_2: There is **no support for Android Auto and Android Automotive OS**, which are both proprietary Google products.
faq_fdroid_changes_3: Donations are accepted through a **PayPal** link instead of the Google Play in-app purchases mechanism.
faq_fdroid_changes_4: The F-Droid version of the app should also work on Android devices that lack the preinstalled Google Play Services.
faq_fdroid_changes_5: Due to F-Droid's policies, we have less control over the release of new updates. Updates will typically appear on F-Droid a few days later than on Google Play.
faq_fdroid_changes_desc: The Mapbox library used for displaying OpenStreetMap maps usually also contains certain proprietary components used for optional telemetry services. These have been removed in both the Google Play and the F-Droid versions of EVMap, to enhance the users' privacy while using Mapbox maps.

faq_chargeprice: Price comparison feature
faq_chargeprice_source: Where does the pricing data come from?
faq_chargeprice_source_desc_1: The pricing information is available in EVMap thanks to the service from our friends at [Chargeprice.app](https://chargeprice.app).
  The data shown within EVMap are identical to those on the Chargeprice website, the developer of EVMap has no direct influence
  on this data and assume no liability for their correctness.
faq_chargeprice_source_desc_2: The calculated total charging cost is an estimate based on the selected vehicle model and the desired state of
  charge, so it should only be considered as an approximate value. The exact cost depends on many factors
  (e.g. reduced charging power with a cold battery, additional consumption through charging loss or heating/cooling
  during charging, etc.), which Chargeprice cannot foresee.
faq_chargeprice_report: How can I report incorrect data?
faq_chargeprice_report_desc: If you find an incorrect price, a missing provider, or have questions about the pricing data, you can contact the
  Chargeprice team directly on their [website](https://chargeprice.app).
faq_chargeprice_order: How are the charging plans sorted?
faq_chargeprice_order_desc: The plans you have selected as "my charging plans" in EVMap's settings will be shown at the beginning of the list
  and with a gray background. All other plans are sorted by the estimated total charging cost in ascending order.
faq_chargeprice_partners: Why are some charging plans highlighted with a different background color and include a provider logo or a coupon code?
faq_chargeprice_partners_desc_1: Certain providers have partnered with Chargeprice to promote their services. If you tap on a plan from such a
  provider to check out further information on the provider's website, Chargeprice receives a small payment.
  If you do this through the EVMap app, these payments will be deducted from the fees that the developer of EVMap needs
  to pay for using the Chargeprice data. So, checking out the services of Chargeprice's partners benefits both
  Chargeprice and EVMap.
faq_chargeprice_partners_desc_2: Nevertheless, Chargeprice is committed to maximum transparency â€” all plans will still be sorted by price, independent
  of whether the provider is a partner or not.
faq_chargeprice_ac_power: Why is the estimated charging power at AC chargers lower than what my car supports?
faq_chargeprice_ac_power_desc: Some European countries with three-phase electricity grids have restrictions on so-called unbalanced loads, i.e. appliances pulling
  a lot of power from a single phase. If your car's onboard charger does not support two- or three-phase charging, this limitation may apply
  to your car as well at AC stations. For example, in Germany the limit for unbalanced loads is 20&nbsp;A, which corresponds to about 4.5&nbsp;kW.
  However, not all public charging stations actually enforce this limit. To calculate prices based on the maximum power your car
  supports, use "Enable unbalanced load" in the app's settings.

faq_permissions: Permissions
faq_permissions_desc: "The following permissions are needed by EVMap:"
faq_permissions_internet: Internet access
faq_permissions_internet_desc: Needed to load information about charging stations from the internet.
faq_permissions_location: Location access while running in the foreground
faq_permissions_location_desc_1: Needed to show your current location on the map and load charging stations nearby.
  This permission is **optional**, since Android 6.0 you can decide if EVMap can access your
  exact (GPS) or approximate (WiFi/mobile network) location or none at all.
faq_permissions_location_desc_2: The Android Auto and Android Automotive OS apps are not usable without the location permission, because
  it always shows nearby charging stations.
faq_permissions_location_desc_3: The app only accesses your location when running in the foreground - starting with Android 10 this is also
  enforced by the system (a separate permission would be needed for background access)
faq_permissions_network_connections: View network and WiFi connections
faq_permissions_network_connections_desc: Used e.g. by the Google Maps and Google Places libraries to check if there is an internet connection
  and to adapt their data usage to the type of connection (mobile data or WiFi).
faq_permissions_android_auto: Special permissions for Android Auto and Android Automotive OS (only Google Play version)
faq_permissions_android_auto_desc: "The Android Auto and Android Automotive OS apps need the following additional permissions:"
faq_permissions_android_auto_1: Access vehicle data (e.g. vehicle GPS)
faq_permissions_android_auto_2: Run foreground service (to use the smartphone's GPS in case the vehicle does not provide this data)
faq_permissions_android_auto_3: Android Car App Library Map Templates (to display the user interface using the templates provided by Android Auto)
faq_permissions_play_billing: Google Play Billing service (only Google Play version)
faq_permissions_play_billing_desc: To support in-app purchases for donations via Google Play

privacy_chargers: Finding charging stations
privacy_chargers_desc: When searching for charging stations, the app will connect to the database of [GoingElectric.de](https://www.goingelectric.de/stromtankstellen/) (GE) or [Open Charge Map](https://openchargemap.org/site) (OCM), depending on which data source has been selected. The search parameters as well as the currently selected area of the map (which may include your current location) as well as your IP address and browser identifier are sent to GE or OCM. The privacy statement of GE can be found [here](https://www.goingelectric.de/datenschutzerklaerung/), and the one from OCM is available [here](https://openchargemap.org/site/about/terms). The processing of this data, including the transfer to GE and OCM is necessary for using the app.
privacy_maps_places: Map view and place search
privacy_maps_places_desc: The map shown in the app as well as the search box for locating places are implemented using Google Maps and/or Mapbox, depending on the app version and user selection. This means that IP addresses and/or browser identifiers can be transmitted to Google Maps or Mapbox, respectively. If the user location is displayed on the map, this data may also be transmitted.
  Phrases entered to the search bar are also sent to Google or Mapbox to provide corresponding search results. Google Maps is a service of Google LLC, their privacy policy is available [here](https://policies.google.com/privacy). Mapbox is a service of Mapbox Inc., whose privacy policy can be found [here](https://www.mapbox.com/legal/privacy).
privacy_availability: Real-time Availability
privacy__availability_desc_1: "When selecting a charger in the app, the app may also connect to separate data sources to provide real-time availability data. This can include any of the following services:"
privacy_availability_newmotion: "[The New Motion](https://my.newmotion.com/)<br>New Motion's privacy policy can be downloaded [here](https://assets.ctfassets.net/ulfvrpf1itxm/67lpNFhJMEpDB2kU88Rp7k/37a1f4ea5c5bb77b5f5005d0262c1256/NewMotion_Privacy_Policy_2018_EN_6.pdf)"

privacy_availability_desc_2: Your IP address and browser identifier as well as the location of the selected charging station are transmitted to one or multiple of these providers to retrieve real-time availabilty data. This is necessary for providing such data within the app.
privacy_availability_desc_3: In the case of Tesla, realtime data are only accessible with a Tesla account. Therefore, EVMap offers a login function to link your own Tesla account to the app. The credentials for the Tesla account are only saved locally within EVMap to be able to retrieve realtime data directly from Tesla. If you do not sign in with your Tesla account, no data will be sent to Tesla.
privacy_availability_predictions: Utilization predictions
privacy_availability_predictions_desc_1: When selecting a charger in the app, utilization prediction data may be loaded from [fronyx](https://fronyx.io/) in case the charging station is supported by them. This means that IP adresses and browser identifiers as well as a unique ID of the selected charger (so-called EVSE ID) may be sent to fronyx. This is necessary to access the prediction data for the selected charger. The utilization prediction feature can be disabled in the app's settings menu, in that case no data will be transmitted to fronyx.
privacy_availability_predictions_desc_2: fronyx's privacy policy can be accessed [here](https://fronyx.io/privacy-policy/).
privacy_price_comparison: Price comparison
privacy_price_comparison_desc: The price comparison service in the app is powered by [Chargeprice.app](https://www.chargeprice.app/). When using the price comparison service (only available in certain regions), your IP address and browser identifier as well as the selected price comparison settings, including vehicle model, state of charge and additional filter settings, are transmitted to Chargeprice.app. When selecting a price listed in the app to proceed to the provider's website, this is done through an affiliate link from Chargeprice.app, which means that this action is also transmitted to Chargeprice for statistical purposes. Chargeprice.app is a service by Chargeprice SAS, and their privacy policy can be found [here](https://www.chargeprice.net/privacy-policy/). Chargeprice and EVMap assume no liability for the correctness of the displayed prices, they are only approximate values.
